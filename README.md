# Ermetic GitHub Actions

Use the Ermetic GitHub actions to scan your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) pipeline for security issues, and to sync from
Cloud to Code to trace your cloud resources and issues back to their code origins. Doing so can help you identify and
remediate configuration issues before your cloud resources are deployed.
